# pongo

Rudimentary Pong game with network multiplayer

## Features

* Bad Pong gameplay with ugly graphics
* Steam Deck build and controller support
* Peer-to-peer network multiplayer with auto-discovery and differential game state sync

## TODO

* Variate bounce angle (randomize? factor-in paddel movement?)
* Check if lower/higher refresh rate affects movement speed
* Render score
